Pushover Broker

The goal of this project is to provide a reliable service of delivering the push notifications via Pushover (see http://pushover.net).

The Pushover Broker is designed to run locally on your device and offer your client code application the same interface as the original Pushover API, but in addition to that make sure that 100% of the push notification messages are always delivered.

Techology

The service is implemented in Go language

Method

The service is implemented using the Test Driven Development for the unit test and Behavior Driven Development for the acceptance tests

Comment

This is my first project in Go, my first RESTful service and first project implemented from the very beginning using the TDD and BDD approach, so I appreciate any feedback or hints on the code or the tests.
